5</span>THE GIANT OF BERN<br />
AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE</h2>
<p>It was the lofty Jutt of Bern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er all the walls he grew;<br />
He was mad and ne&rsquo;er at rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tame him no one knew.</p>
<p>He was mad and ne&rsquo;er at rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No lord could hold him in;<br />
If he had long in Denmark stayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much damage there had been.</p>
<p>It was the lofty Jutt of Bern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bound to his side his glaive,<br />
And away to the monarch&rsquo;s house he rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the knights a fray to have.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Now goes the lofty Jutt of Bern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the King to stand:<br />
&ldquo;Thou shalt to me thy daughter give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a brief for half thy land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here as thou sitt&rsquo;st at thy wide board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail Monarch of the Danes!<br />
Thou shalt to me thy daughter give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the half of thy domains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt to me thy daughter give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And divide with me thy land,<br />
Or thou shalt find a kempion good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ring &rsquo;gainst me to stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O thou shalt ne&rsquo;er my daughter get,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor a brief for half my land,<br />
I&rsquo;ll quickly find a kempion good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall fight thee hand to hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then strode the Monarch of the Danes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his castle hall amain:<br />
&ldquo;Now which of ye, my courtiers, will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lovely Damsel gain?</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Here sit ye all my Danish swains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On whom I bread bestow,<br />
Now which of ye will risk his life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lay the Berner low?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give to him my daughter dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wondrous lovely may,<br />
Who in the ring with Jutt of Bern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall dare the desperate fray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence all the kempions sat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; None dared reply a word,<br />
Except alone Orm Ungerswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowest at the board.</p>
<p>Except alone Orm Ungerswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He bounded o&rsquo;er the board:<br />
I tell to ye in verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spake a manly word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou to me thy daughter give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And divide with me thy land?<br />
O then will I the kempion be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the Jutt to stand.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;And well will I your daughter win,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the prize alone will earn;<br />
I am the lad to dare the fray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ring with the Jutt of Bern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the lofty Jutt of Bern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He o&rsquo;er his shoulder glar&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;O who may yonder mouseling be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom those words I heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mouseling I, though call me, Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A mouseling if you will,<br />
My father was good Sigurd King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who slumbers in his hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! was thy sire good Sigurd King?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;st something of his face,<br />
Thou hast sprung up full wondrously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fifteen winter&rsquo;s space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so late at evening tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun had reached the wave,<br />
When Orm the youthful swain set out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek his father&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>It was the hour when grooms do ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The coursers to the rill,<br />
That Orm set out resolved to wake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead man in the hill.</p>
<p>Now strikes the bold Orm Ungerswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hill with such a might,<br />
It was I ween a miracle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It tumbled not outright.</p>
<p>Then stamped upon the hill so hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Orm with heavy foot,<br />
The arch was broke within the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which trembled to its root.</p>
<p>Then from the hill Orm&rsquo;s father cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he so long had lain:<br />
&ldquo;O cannot I in quiet lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within my murky den?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dares so early break my rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And troubleth thus my bones?<br />
Cannot I in quiet lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath my roof of stones?</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Who seeks at night the dead man&rsquo;s hill<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And works this ruin all?<br />
Let him fear for now I swear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Birting he shall fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thy son, thy youngest son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Orm, O father dear;<br />
To beg a boon in mighty need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I come to seek thee here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou art Orm my youngest son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The kempion bold and brave,<br />
Last year I gave to thee of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All, all thy heart could crave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year you gave me store of gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which I set no worth,<br />
Now I this year must Birting have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bravest sword on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never shalt thou Birting get<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To win the Monarch&rsquo;s daughter,<br />
Until to Ireland thou hast been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To &rsquo;venge thy father&rsquo;s
slaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Give to me the Birting sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with it bid me thrive,<br />
Or I the hill above thee will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thousand pieces rive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stretch thou down thy hand and take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Birting from my side,<br />
But if thou break thy father&rsquo;s hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much woe will thee betide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cast to him the sword, its point<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Appeared above the mould:<br />
&ldquo;Save good fate on thee shall wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ne&rsquo;er shall be consol&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached to him the sword, and placed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its hilt within his grasp:<br />
&ldquo;Beneath its blows may all thy foes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before thee sink and grasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then took the sword Orm Ungerswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on his shoulder plac&rsquo;d;<br />
And to the Monarch&rsquo;s hall he sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast as he could haste.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>It was the lofty Jutt of Bern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wrath was nearly wild:<br />
&ldquo;It ill becomes a man like me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To battle with a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I be but little, Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fearless heart I keep,<br />
And oftentimes a little hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;erturns a mighty heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two long days they fought, and when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The third to evening tended,<br />
&ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; exclaim&rsquo;d the Berner Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This fight will ne&rsquo;er be
ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was bold Orm Ungerswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His good sword brandish&rsquo;d he,<br />
And of the lofty Berner Jutt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Asunder cut the knee.</p>
<p>Loud bellowed then the Berner Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud he fell to ban:<br />
&ldquo;It ne&rsquo;er was warrior custom yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So low to strike one&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;I was small, and thou wast tall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy prowess I admire;<br />
I only struck thy knee because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not reach thee higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then took the bold Orm Ungerswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His faulchion on his back,<br />
And to the ocean strand he goes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast as he could make.</p>
<p>It was bold Orm Ungerswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He paced the yellow sand,<br />
And lo! Sir Tord of Valland came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swift sailing to the land.</p>
<p>Foremost upon the gilded prow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tord of Valland stands:<br />
&ldquo;O who is yonder little man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That walks upon the sands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I am Orm, the youthful swain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A kempion bold and fine;<br />
&rsquo;Twas I that slew the Berner Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That uncle dear of thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;If thou hast slain the Berner Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That uncle dear of mine,<br />
&rsquo;Twas I the King of Ireland slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beloved father thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Tord of Valland then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With faulchion struck the earth:<br />
&ldquo;Never will I make amends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By gold or money&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was bold Orm Ungerswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He grasped his faulchion&rsquo;s hilt:<br />
&ldquo;In vengeance for my father then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall valiant blood be spilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the bold Orm Ungerswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew his trusty sword,<br />
And at a single blow smote off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The head of Valland&rsquo;s Tord.</p>
<p>Valland&rsquo;s Tord he slew, and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His followers every one;<br />
Then speeds he to the monarch&rsquo;s house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To claim the maid he&rsquo;d won.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>O&rsquo;er Helmer Isle the tidings run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast as levin fire,<br />
That Orm the lovely maid has won,<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
